`DeepRequired<Type>` constructs a type by picking all properties from type `Type` recursively and setting as required

```ts
interface DeepPartialCompany {
  name?: string | undefined;
  employees?: ({ name?: string | undefined } | undefined)[] | undefined;
}

type Company = DeepRequired<DeepPartialCompany>;
//   ^? { name: string; employees: { name: string }[] }
```

Useful when deep partial object type is a source of truth and you need to have required object type, e.g. for default
values:

```ts
const defaultCompany: Company = {
  name: "Unidentified company name",
  employees: [
    {
      name: "Unidentified CEO name",
    },
  ],
};
```
